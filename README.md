🔹 Key Insights

Most products have ratings clustered between ⭐4.0–4.3, showing high customer satisfaction.

Discounts varied widely across categories, with some offering up to 90% off.

The top 6 categories accounted for the majority of products.

A few products dominated in terms of reviews, highlighting popularity concentration.

Correlation analysis showed weak links between discounts and ratings, suggesting discounts don’t strongly impact customer satisfaction.

Some reviewers were highly active, contributing disproportionately to review counts.

🔹 Conclusion
This EDA revealed that while discounts attract attention, customer ratings remain consistently high, which may indicate brand loyalty and product quality as key drivers of customer trust. Category-level analysis helps identify where competitive pricing strategies and marketing can make the most impact.
