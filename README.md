🔎 Exploring Amazon Sales Data with Python

📌 Objective
The goal of this project was to conduct an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Amazon sales and product reviews dataset. The focus was on uncovering meaningful insights around product performance, customer reviews, discounts, and category trends.

⚙️ Technologies Used

Python 🐍

Pandas & NumPy → Data cleaning and transformation

Matplotlib & Seaborn → Data visualization and charts

Regular Expressions (Regex) → Cleaning textual and numerical data

📊 Key Insights from the Analysis

The dataset contained 1,465 records with product, review, and pricing details.

Average product rating: ⭐ 4.09, showing generally positive customer sentiment.

Discounts ranged up to 94%, but higher discounts did not always guarantee better ratings.

Certain categories dominated the platform, with Computers & Accessories leading product count.

Top reviewers contributed a significant share of feedback, showing high customer engagement.

Correlation analysis showed a weak relationship between discount percentage and rating — suggesting discounts aren’t the only factor influencing satisfaction.

🎯 Project Goal
To build a structured data pipeline and dashboard-ready insights that can help businesses understand what drives sales, customer trust, and product success on e-commerce platforms.

💡 Business Problem
E-commerce platforms like Amazon deal with millions of products and reviews. Businesses need to identify:

Which products perform best?

How do discounts affect perception?

Which categories generate maximum engagement?

What customer feedback trends emerge?

📈 Business Impact

Data-driven decision-making: Insights help sellers refine pricing strategies and promotions.

Customer understanding: Review analysis highlights pain points and satisfaction drivers.

Category focus: Identifying high-performing categories allows better inventory and marketing planning.

✅ Conclusion
This project highlights the power of data analytics in e-commerce. By combining data cleaning, EDA, and visualization, we can transform raw data into actionable insights that directly impact sales strategies, customer experience, and overall business growth.
